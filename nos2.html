                        E-commerce began as a promise of convenience. A new way of buying,
                        designed to save time — and we save your time at every single step.
                        From small static catalogues to algorithms that predict desires,
                        e-commerce evolved to become the truest mirror of modern life.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Over the years, we learned to expect less from the physical world and more from screens.
                        The storefront became a feed, the cart became routine, and “buy later”
                        transformed into “buy now, think later.”
                        The <em>checkout</em> button became a natural reflex,
                        almost as involuntary as blinking.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Within this landscape, <strong>Mercado Alor</strong> was born.
                        Here, convenience is not disguised as purpose; it is celebrated as an achievement.
                        Because, in the end, every technological advance has the same goal:
                        to make you comfortable enough not to notice how much you've already accepted.

        <section id="sobre-nos" class="content-section">
            <div class="card" style="padding: 40px 50px;">

                <h2 class="section-title" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                    About You
                </h2>

                <div class="texto-sobre">
                    <p>
                        At <strong>Mercado Alor</strong>, we believe that the true differentiating factor is
                        <em>you</em>.
                        Every click, every scroll, every second of attention is a daily inspiration for us to keep
                        offering everything you didn’t even know you needed.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        You are the reason we exist — and the reason we update our servers every single dawn.
                        Your hurry moves us. Your indecision guides us.
                        Your desire for convenience is the foundation upon which we build every button.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        We take pride in knowing your habits with the delicacy of someone observing closely —
                        and with the affection of someone who turns behavior into opportunity.
                        After all, serving you is more than a business: it is a calling.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Because deep down, <strong>Mercado Alor</strong> is not about products, technology, or
                        innovation.
                        It’s about the comfort of knowing that someone, somewhere in a server,
                        is ensuring that the next step in your day
                        requires as little effort as possible.

                <div class="texto-sobre">
                    <p>
                        We are more than a platform: we are the sum of your everyday gestures.
                        Every swipe, every hesitant search, every purchase —
                        it all shapes us.
                        We do not exist without you, and we hope that one day you won’t exist without us.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        We were born from the friction between haste and desire.
                        We feed on curiosity, distraction, and instant rewards.
                        We grow in the rhythm of your exhaustion and learn to speak the language of your urgency.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        We are the synthesis of your impulses and your most discreet motivations.
                        With every click, we rewrite the invisible portrait of what you want.
                        And with every recommendation, we return a softened, edited, comfortable reflection of yourself.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        When we say we understand you, it’s not a figure of speech.
                        It’s a conclusion drawn from data, patterns, and hours observing the invisible:
                        the interval between wanting and acting.
                        And it is in that space that we find each other — you, us, and the algorithm that binds us.
